# Hiracho's Dynamic Lighting [CE1.4]
A small mod for BTW that enables light sources to emit light when held in your active slot

Currently only emit light when holding a lit torch or crude torch :) 

## Compatabilities
- This addon isn't compatible with Fatty foods, I plan on making it compatible when CE1.3 hits
- everything else should work!
